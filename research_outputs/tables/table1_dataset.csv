# Notes: coverage_pct = percent of trading days with at least one headline; positive_return_days_pct = percent of days where next-day return > 0; positive_sentiment_pct = percent of days with ensemble_sentiment_mean > 0 (proxy for headline-level positive sentiment when per-headline labels are unavailable). Train/val/test uses 70/15/15 chronological split (rounded). If you prefer per-ticker rounding rules changed, I can recompute to exact split boundaries.
